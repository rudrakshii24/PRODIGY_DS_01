Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the distribution of ages or gender in the population.

Spotify Visualization
This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution within a population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the age demographics of a population.
Data Source: It appears you've created visualizations based on data from Spotify, likely related to music listening habits.

Visualization Types:

Bar Graph: This graph likely represents categorical data, such as the number of songs listened to by genre, artist, or other categories.
Histogram: This graph likely represents continuous data, such as the distribution of song duration or play counts.
Analysis:

Without the actual data or graphs, it's impossible to provide a specific analysis. However, here are some potential insights you might glean from your visualizations:

Bar Graph: Identify popular genres, artists, playlists, or other categories based on the height of the bars. You might see trends in listening habits.
Histogram: Analyze how listening habits are distributed.
